As an application written by me, it...

1. scrapes restaurant health inspection data from (currently) four Portland-area county websites
2. rearranges the inspection and location data and inserts it into MongoDB
3. geocodes the addresses of the restaurant locations
4. provides a map application for mobile-web guide to the latest health inspection scores of restaurants near you, based on your current location
