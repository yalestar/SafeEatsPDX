Notes:
=================================================================
4/18/2012: switched from MongoHQ to MongoLab (not enough storage on HQ free plan, although I may switch to their 5/mo. plan)			
Use: heroku config | grep MONGOLAB_URI
to get connection info (see: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab#database_connection_information)

Implement this fucker:
  http://www.civicapps.org/ideas/safeeats-portland-restaurant-health-inspection-reports
  Restaurant Health Inspection Reports with maps

Parse these:
	http://www.co.clackamas.or.us/foodinspection/ris.php
	http://www3.multco.us/MCHealthInspect/ListSearch.aspx
	http://washtech.co.washington.or.us/restaurantinspections/

google maps thing should have a tabbed popup like padmapper.com
