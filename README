Implement this fucker:
  http://www.civicapps.org/ideas/safeeats-portland-restaurant-health-inspection-reports
  Restaurant Health Inspection Reports with maps

Parse these:
	http://www.co.clackamas.or.us/foodinspection/ris.php
	http://www3.multco.us/MCHealthInspect/ListSearch.aspx
	http://washtech.co.washington.or.us/restaurantinspections/
	
google maps thing should have a tabbed popup like padmapper.com
maybe some clever symbology would be in order?
do geocoding batch-style
Also maybe send out Twitter notices of new inspections?
RSS?
